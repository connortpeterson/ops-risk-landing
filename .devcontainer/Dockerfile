# Use an official Node 18 image as the base
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-18

# Make sure we pick up our .nvmrc (optional; the base image already sets node16 → node18 automatically)
# We’ll rely on the base image’s Node 18 install, so nothing extra is needed here beyond the FROM line.
